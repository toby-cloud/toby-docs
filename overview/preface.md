# Overview

## Toby MQTT Server
Toby is a simple but powerful application that gives you the ability to create lightning-fast, multi-directional communication channels between all your internet connected devices. It is built using [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/faq), a lightweight network protocol, designed to be used in constrained devices on unreliable networks. Toby abstracts the complicated process of establishing a secure MQTT connection between devices into a simple, intuitive API.


## Toby-Cloud Clients
Toby-Cloud is a suite of Toby clients at its [github page](https://github.com/toby-cloud). Toby works on anything that can establish an MQTT connection. This means it can work on virtually any device, including Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, smart phones, and browsers. We have client libraries available in several different languages, and are in the process of creating more.


## Ekho
[Ekho](ekho.io) is an application that harnesses Toby's power in an unconventional IoT setting - between a mobile phone and a laptop.
